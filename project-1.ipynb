    "Welcome to your term project! This is the first portion of a two-part, open-ended team assignment that will culminate in a presentation during the last week of class or the regularly scheduled final exam period. Overall, this term project is intended to provide some open-ended experience with building a complex dataset and making it available. Specifically, all projects for this course will entail the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The construction, acquistion, integration, enrichment, and distribution of a project-motivated and computationally significant dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first report on your team's project will constitue a discussion of what the dataset is that you want to build/access/create, why you believe it will be possilbe to conduct, and how long you believe it will take to build, in addition to discussion of the sorts of tasks that will be involved. Additionally, this inital project planning report should speculate and provide examples potential dataset uses, whether academic or commercial.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Note__: All reports should inclue a high level abstract/discussion in a tone that is set for a completely diverse audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later on, a final report will recap progress at the task you're group has come up with, specifically revisiting what you _though_ the dataset development would take,  as compared to the actual work involved and obstacles encountered.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Important__: because your project reports will have discussion intermingled with data and code as output, I not only request the  submission of your work in Jupyter Notebooks format, but additionly recommend conducting your work as a group collaboratively in Jupyter notebooks."

The courses of different projects will require overcoming different obstacles, and success in a data science project is ultimately a (partial) function of a team's abaility to adapt to project needs. However, all work should be well documented, articulately presented, and justified.

Data science is often conducted in teams, with different team members covering the diversity of knowledge and skills relevant to the different areas that a project must support to succeed. Even though our course is only focused on early-phase data science tasks (data set development), be sure to consider the strengths of your teamates and interests for gaining experience in dataset construction&mdash;if you want extensive experience with web scraping, pitch a project about this with a few other interested points. It will help to discuss interests. Be sure to write out the names of the project team's members in your first report and answer the two questions:\n",

So, as you identify a potential data set be sure to be realistic about what is possible to collect and how you can preprocess it for use! Ultimately, please make sure that some portion of your target data are guarenteed to be collectable. However, it's okay to try for some data that are a reach, just document any un- or partially successful efforts in your report and discuss what obstacles prevented those data from being collected.\n",

    "•\t **Justin**: Data science and quant dev intern at hedge fund; undergrad in corp. Finance; additional coursework in compsci (C, C++); some computational finance and algorithmic trading; little industry experience due to career change. Good with: basic Python programming; managing git repos for groups; some use of ftplib and beauutifulsoup.\n",

    "•\t **Kevin**: I received my undergrad in Finance from Penn State.  I’ve worked in a corporate finance role in the healthcare industry throughout my career.  I taught myself Python over the past 3 years in order to streamline my job and work on various hobbies.  I’m experienced with data analysis (pandas, numpy, matplotlib), web scraping (beautifulsoup), and basic Python programming.  My contributions to this project could be assisting with scraping various data around the web as well as processing and cleaning it up.  I hope to learn best practices from my other teammates as well as share some knowledge if I’m able.\n",

    "•\t **Joe**: A life-long learner, (read old man), who is interested in relearning a topic he learned many years ago at Penn State - earning a Master in Expect system using Java in combination with calculus-based statistics (rusty in both). Currently working in management at a GSE and does little to no coding during the day. Drexel EE, and a GE Master black belt so OK on the math skills, I do not know it cold but a quick YouTube starts the neurons firing.  I have taken a bunch of Coursera classes in Data Science so my R is rusty and slow, but I can get it done in time. I learned a bunch about a lot of different R and Python packages, I get the major points. Python - taking CS570 - 910 so just above novice on that skill. \n",
    "\n",
    "•\t **Sandra**: :  Coming from Accounting background, looking to advance in Information Technology focusing to become a data science expert, though have little knowledge of python, I strive to advance my career for a greater tomorrow, for the past four month I have been studying  python for data science from Udemy to gain basic knowledge which have been a great advantage to me in this course though still not too familiar with some libraries. I must get it right is my goal."

At a base level, I'd also like to gain a entry level understanding of scraping and making use of financial data which may not otherwise be sourced from a vendor.\n",

    "\n",
    "•\t **Joe**: Just a guess as we are all still learning - but the problem to solving is how volatile is a stock and how much of that volatility can be account for as a leading or lag indicator from Social media?  What is the correlation and time-sensitive of these factors?  Or another view could be if we expanded beyond one stock symbols  of the companies that are still run by the founder is social media sediment a good leading indicator? The last guess I will make is how good is social media able to offer insight into product performance and if a large enough fraction of sales will it be and impact to stock price?    \n",

As for the twitter data, I'd imagine there are message pull limits with regard to how much the api can be utilized for an academic purpose; both scenarios limit the data usage under some license terms and those terms should be respected so as to not violate licensing agreements.\n",
