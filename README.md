# DSCI511 Group Project

The original project was to create a shareable project to assist in buy and sell decisions for different stocks, this could address items like how volatile is a stock and how much of that volatility can be account for as a leading or lag indicator from Social media? What is the correlation and time-sensitive of these factors? 

As the team lost members, we had to refocus our efforts to exam just one stock as to keep the volume of data to a reasonable level and to focus on obtain the data and how best to refined for our intended goals, finding a small leading indicator of stock price movement.
